@andreq That's pretty much the opposite of what I need: I want to reload ONLY the undownloaded pages, and then stop once they load
Reload Every seems like an incomplete fix -- does it have the smarts to *stop* reloading once the page is successfully loaded?

You always can tell when a copyright industry shill is losing the argument because they change the subject to Google's riches
Shill: "Google! Google! They have MONEY!" Copyfighter: "What's that got to do with anything?" Lawmaker: "I find this VERY persuasive"
Copyfighter: "Yer arguments're crap, the laws you want won't work, & your industry screws artists." Shill: "O yah? Look over there! GOOGLE!"
It may be the only issue in which the US Congress can be convinced a fight is just because one of its opponents has commercial success
#SOPA is prior restraint on speech. Ih, yeah? Do you know how much Google makes?
Like the Animal Farm sheep bleating 4 Legs Good 2 Legs Bad whenever Napoleon starts losing an argument
When arguing Internet freedom w entertainment shills, their tactic of last recourse is to start talking about how much money Google makes
