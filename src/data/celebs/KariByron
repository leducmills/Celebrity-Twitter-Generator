@theaarondouglas ;) I will tell @ToryBelleci you send your love.
Taking yesterday's accident very seriously. So happy everyone is all right. So sorry to all who have been affected.
We are meeting this morning to make sure we are doing everything we can to take care of the community affected by the loose cannonball.
Thank you for all the love and support.  Even though we are doing all we can, having a hard time with this.
