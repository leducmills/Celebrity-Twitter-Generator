Last night's Colbert Report (where he sings a song with Brian Eno and Michael Stipe!) was one of the finest half-hours of TV EVER. No lie.
@jcarlson23 yes!
For clarity's sake, it should be noted that Jamie and I will be appearing on the Mythbusters tour, not Kari, Tory or Grant.
The touring show's going to have a ton of audience participation. We have nefarious things planned for volunteers. Heh heh.
To all those wondering if we're coming to your city, the answer is: eventually. We're super excited about this show. it's gonna be fun.
Our touring show will be TOTALLY appropriate for children. And everyone else.
Also: Jamie and I are on Talk of the Nation: Science Friday with Ira today!  Tune in.

@onthemedia You guys have my favorite show on radio.
The interviews in today's episode of "On the Media" on NPR are some of their best EVER. Nice work Brooke and Bob.
Tweeps: thanks SO much for all the kind support. FYI, Mythbusters has NOT be suspended/cancelled. We're still in production. Happy holidays.
Now it's back to SF, to meet and discuss how to keep this from ever happening again. Very intense. We're SUPER relieved no one was hurt.
It's true, a cannonball got away from a Mythbusters experiment in Dublin, CA. Nobody hurt thank goodness. Jamie and I toured the damage.
Here's MY favorite gift guide so far. (via wirecutter) http://t.co/BDjS32zR

We will NOT be including the cannonball mishap in the episode. That just doesn't seem right to us. You know?
