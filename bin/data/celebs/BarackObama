The payroll tax cut would give more than 113 million Americans an extra $1,500—paid for by a 3.25% surcharge on income over $1 million.
Did you know: 83 percent of American households pay payroll taxes. Every one of those households would pay more if the tax cut expires.
The President is urging Congress to cut taxes for working families by asking the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans to pay their fair share.
