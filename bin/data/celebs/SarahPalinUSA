We should eliminate it for everyone & also cut corp welfare to fight crony capitalism while letting the private sector create American jobs.
Glad Santorum wants to re-industrialize USA w/ eliminating the corp income tax on manufactures.
Dang - spoke too rapidly on @hannityshow; should have clarified I'm for eliminating "fed corporate income tax."
Thank you, Storm Lake, Iowa. You put on a great event & we loved meeting some great folks in your beautiful town today!

@BarackObama you're wrong, threatening to throw seniors under the bus because you refuse to prioritize govt spending.Time to #womanup & lead
@BarackObama wants us to support a "balanced deficit solution." Great idea! How about a balanced budget amendment?
@BarackObama wants us to contact Congress. Great idea! Tell them to rein in our dangerously unsustainable debt to protect our credit rating.
