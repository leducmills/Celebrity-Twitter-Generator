@JoyVBehar Hey, you're show's going off the air? Too bad. Great show.
The White House shooter says he’s a “modern day Jesus.” This makes sense because I remember when Jesus was shooting at people.

@ARShowcase Interview period over for the season.
From my hilarious new auto-tweet app: “Isn’t it funny when people get pulverized into pellets?” Whoa, not that funny.
Just got a new Twitter app that writes tweets, reads them, and sends funny  replies. Real timesaver.

Thanksgiving is wonderful. But let's remember to give thanks every day of the week except Fridays, Tuesdays, and every other Monday.
I got no Thanksgiving gifts this year. What the hey?
@Kelsey3d Hmm. Thinking.
Taking down the Thanksgiving tree. The holidays were so short this year.
@FlackOps A galaxy IS a solar system. According to Fox fact checking.
@vesuviusathome Didn't realize it was Fox News until tweeted, but still....
@bradfrideres I wish.
I love this story: http://t.co/qAAi1HMl
@AlecBaldwin But you are Bill Holden.
@TheRichardLewis Richard, can I use that tweet on Letterman, Fallon, on stage, and in any future media?
We’re aloft!  But still in the tunnel.
We just taxied through the Lincoln Tunnel. The wings folded. It was amazing. Now in Jersey.
@KaraKreativ Taxiing now down Broadway.
@Karnzee Plantains and automobiles.
@Mikezzz33 Too many abbreviations.
American Airlines filed for bankruptcy just when I’m on one of its planes which is now endlessly taxiing.

@wonderfulmayhem When?
@SteveMartinToGo @AneirinStokes Ugh. I meant "can." Can't do nothin' today.
@Rob_N_SoCal Wool.
@AneirinStokes Better. If I can't perfect this tweet I can change the world.
@MrJoshCharles three chords on guitar. But tough ones.
Uh, perhaps I should have said an eggplant is pear-shaped. Or perhaps I should has said whether it was Japanese, Italian, or Thai.
@ToddDiksa Doesn't spherical mean sphere-ish?
@g0tti Okay, spheroid.
@lindsaybea Elliptoidal?
STEVE MARTIN’S NUMBER ONE PRODUCT OF THE YEAR: Eggplant. 
Smooth. Spherical. Purple.
@SouthernJetNC Nice one.
Life is just a series of Tweets.

Hat. Mittens. Go. Buy tree! $200? Get ax. Rockefeller Ctr. Shimmy. Needles! Ow. Chop top. Run! Taxi bad idea. Home. Trim. Wait 4 gifts!
I killed on Fallon tonight. And that is not a metaphor. Now, I'm on the lam.
Love this photo of me and David Letterman! http://t.co/IjEI8Ivu
Preparing for Fallon Show tonight by staring out window and imagining “great Fallon show.”
@jackiehall10 If at all, not till summer.
Starting to drink health wheatgrass juice in preparation for Jimmy Fallon appearance Monday night. With @steepcanyon.
Some of you may get DMs from @TheTenMakeThatNine asking for ok to use replies for my tweet book. Please respond. It’s legit! Free book!
@wormbolt @JuddApatow Impossible.
@JuddApatow It takes two to create an anecdote.
Now playing Words with Friends on playground slide. Been asked to turn it off by my teacher. Won't. #neednewsheadline.
@larryrother It's a great one, but....
Actually that twitter address for my book should have read @The10MakeThat9. No more daytime drinking!
@cam311 Yep.
@AlbertBrooks Uh, Albert, I think martyr, is spelled "martyrque."
@ScottWardBand Finally, someone knows how to spell banjer.
@gratone23 Lower case crackwhore?
@coxasaurus Uh, missing an apostrophe.
@Peace_Janise None of the above.
@Dubn8r And?
@MichaelChong3 I heard a rumor that the guy who could spell died today. Obviously...
@ShawnBrennan101 You see it my way.
@Wolf_six You don't respond much anymore.
NEWS: Discovery of a black hole the size of nearly 10 billion Suns. Oh, please. Yawn. I’m nominated for a Grammy.
@DeeAnn3141592 Not sure. I think if you sell it as a multiple, you need permission. That's my guess.
@rebeccapidgeon Hey, Rebecca!  Thanks so much. Hello to all.
@AlbertBrooks Great career move!
@pennjillette Looking forward to spending holy Christmas holidays with you!
@clementsk52 Thanks for the reminder. I wonder what song?
Can’t wait for this NBA season to be over.  So tired of watching.
Trying to get American Airlines to turn off the engine while I finish this game of Angry Birds.
@DBA72 Simple cut and paste.
That's right: "Jeremy Porter @JerPort 2h ... O what fun it is to jingle completely to fruition with others!" Happy Holidays!
@brandib73 Ha!
Last verse! ? Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way! O what fun it is to …?
That's right, Lea Hargis @AgoldenkeyRS 2h "making spirits quickly reference google for the meaning of A Bob Tail."
Next verse: ? Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits…?
That's right! Mark Taylor @mt575757 3h "ignoring rural property rights!"
Next! ? Over the fields we go…?
Lots of good ones, but going with "On a "On a >>> pre-election promise of funding for green transport...."
It’s Christmas sing-along time!  I’ll sing the first line, you complete it!  ? Dashing through the snow, On a…?
Christmas singalong coming up!
Christmas singalong later today!
When do the Democratic debates start?
Most of the contestants in the current debates seem to be Republicans. Is that fair?
Just did Joy Behar.
Because of my being over sixty, using satellite photography for next publicity photo.
@ErickaAStout @@SteveMartinToGo Not about the name.
I&#39;ll be on @JoyVBehar tonight. Don&#39;t tell my trusting wife.
