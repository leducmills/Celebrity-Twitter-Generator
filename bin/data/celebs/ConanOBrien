Just hired some out-of-work NBA players to swat raccoons off my roof.
Herman Cain says, “We need a leader, not a reader.” Is it me, or did @TheHermanCain just endorse Rick Perry?
Eating alone in an Italian restaurant and this is on the table. I think I'll use my vermicelli to make him a thong: http://t.co/cLzIuZ0p
Question: If I decide to switch from Team Edward to Team Jacob, how will that affect my rollover minutes?
iTunes just told me I’m the only person to ever download The Knack’s second album.
The downside of fame? I can’t walk out of a nice restaurant without immediately getting harassed and hounded by a waiter holding the bill.
Los Angeles hasn’t changed me. I still put on leather pants one leg at a time.
I wonder if this month’s issue of @MensHealthMag will have any articles about abs.
I heard that @THEHermanCain said the sexual harassment charges are making him more popular than ever. #HeyTwitterNiceRack!
I know how Rick Perry feels. The other day I couldn’t remember the name of the third Police Academy movie.
I can’t believe it’s 11/11/11. Seems like just yesterday it was 11/10/11.
So a celebrity can just mention a product on Twitter and then they get them sent to them for free? OVEN MITTS!!!
Once Regis retires, I’ll have no more competition for weirdest first name on the air.
On tonight’s show, Cheryl Hines undresses me with her eyes. Then dresses me again. And adds a hat.
In North America yesterday, for a few seconds, the entire internet went down. Or, as it's known in my house, "The Day I Spoke to my Wife."
With all this negative attention on Herman Cain right now, I’ll bet Little Caesar is grabbing boobs like there’s no tomorrow.
Just realized what this means on my NY taxi meter: my cab driver is foreign. http://t.co/m4fBcS1m
Got in a fight about the Treaty of Versailles. I said the German fines were too punitive; the guy at Starbucks said buy something or leave.
Leaving NY. Does the E Train stop in LA? http://t.co/w7dWp8e4
Triumph is on the show tonight. I am very worried. http://t.co/RHuYyxNW
Back home in Brookline, MA and I visited my 4th grade classroom. This is where I became the jock I am today: http://t.co/dhHZNIh6
Can’t believe it’s not even Thanksgiving and some people are already putting up their Christmas tweets.
So stuffed, I'm kicking back in a comfy chair with my pants off. This is one laid-back Ikea.
I’m here at Walmart, Christmas shopping on Black Friday. Hope my kids like Sheryl Crow CDs.
Scotch looks delicious, but then you take one sip and it tastes like a leather furniture store that's on fire.
Men's room sign: either wash your hands with foam, or that poor bastard is missing a big chunk of his right hand: http://t.co/GfKpMQ3u
Not gonna say what I bought, but Amazon just reviewed my order and said, “You might also be interested in therapy.”
On my way to work, this sign inspired me to anonymously do good. And then tweet about it to 4.4 million people. http://t.co/ErROsQ3D
I think Regis has too much time on his hands. I just found him weeding my garden.
Hey, @NickKroll told a delightfully horrifying story on my show tonight. Check it out.
When will someone build a piano that isn’t inherently racist?
Kobe Bryant has a lot of work to do to get ready for the season. We just played one-on-one, and he only beat me 200-4.
First my kids stopped believing in Santa. Then they stopped believing in Herman Cain.
I received 14 more Grammy nominations this year! (I call grey hairs “Grammy nominations”)

I just found out the Gregorian calendar is not based on Greg Brady.
Visited the @ChildrensHealth medical center today with @JustinBieber, @SelenaGomez, & @VictoriaJustice. I was the only one who sang.
I took my kids to see the guy in the red suit today. That’s right, the Spider-Man on Hollywood Boulevard.
Are you really supposed to tip your mailman’s mailman for Christmas or am I being conned?
One of the nation’s defense agencies has a new app out for tracking Santa Claus. So it sounds like we’re finally going to capture the SOB.
They discovered bed bugs can procreate with their siblings. This is not the image boost bed bugs needed.
Good news for Trump: Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth have agreed to let him moderate their debate.
Using cutting edge 2007 video technology, we've created "The Conan One Hour Earlier Best Of Spectacular" tonight at 10pm on TBS. Enjoy.
