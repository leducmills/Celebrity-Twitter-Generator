Dear Twitter Friends, please hang on. I’m working on Step One for the secret to Real Peace.
The secret to Real Peace, I will tell you next week if you ask me. All the best to you. Your friend, David.
I want to tell you how REAL PEACE can be a reality for us all. It's time to stop pretending that our dear politicians can solve anything.
I am traveling now but will be back home next week. Please ask me about Maharishi's Peace Creating Groups.
Dear Twitter Friends, let's take a look at this World of Ours. So much suffering these days, so many problems, so much negativity.

Now I'm working on a lithograph called “Oh, A Bad Dream Comes.” Please tell me what you are working on and about your dreams for the future.
I was very busy working on the installation of a show on mathematics at the Fondation Cartier in Paris.
Dear Twitter Friends, I'm sorry I haven’t been in touch with you for awhile.
I really think you will like this music. So take a ride on This Train. http://t.co/xXzBa01M

Dear Twitter Friends, I've been working w/ @Chrysta_Bell for many years. She's such a great singer. A real beauty she is.

This can really happen. Let’s figure a way to work together & make this happen for our world family.  Thank you for listening & considering.
Let’s get rid of the suffering and bring real peace, which is not just the absence of war, but the absence of all negativity.
Too many people are suffering these days.
Let’s get together somehow and figure a way to support large peace creating groups in the world on a permanent basis.

Bill Maher could have a great talk w/Evan, he should have him on his show some time.
Check it out if you can. As Evan describes it, “ A light tough on a heavy subject.”
Dear Twitter Friends, thousands of you enjoyed Evan Finkelstein's last writings. His latest piece in Elephant Magazine is called, “God.”
